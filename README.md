# ordinarydaygame
Hosted at www.ordinarydaygame.com *** STILL IN BETA ***


This project was started at Blueprint@Mit 2016 by Audrey Kintisch, Krystal Kim, Ethan Foster, and Garcia Lu.  
It has since been continued by Audrey Kintisch.

An in-test version of the site is hosted at http://www.ordinarydaygame.com.  The site is focused on collaborative text adventures.
Anyone can add events to a text adventure, aka trail, but whoever created the trail is the only one who can accept those changes and make them public.

The documentation is a little out of the ordinary, but works well for me.  
Find it here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e6rDX2h42nJO6knZwIRvzqW2iQP6eHsbuch67OmsMLo/edit#gid=1282397833


The site is far from complete, but unfortunately, I will only be able to work on it sporadically until the summer.  
However, it is still functional and able to be used.  If you would like to check it out, enjoy!  Any and all feedback is appreciated.
